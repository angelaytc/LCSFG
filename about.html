          <h1>About</h1>
          <p1>The London Chinese Science Fiction Group is a community for people interested in Chinese language (sinophone) science and speculative fiction (SF). 
            <br><br>Sinophone SF from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and the global diaspora has been gaining a wider readership through translations into many other languages over the recent years. We began this group as one way to offer anglophone readers a space to thoughtfully and enjoyably discuss these narratives, and sometimes, their cultural specificities. We hope to encourage the community to read translated stories by emerging science and speculative writers, as opposed to reiterating a prescribed literary canon-in-the-making, so as to reflect the diversity of backgrounds and experiences across Chinese language SF. 
            <br><br>The LCSFG was co-founded by Lyu Guangzhao and Angela Chan. Since April 2019, we have been organising a monthly in-person reading and discussion group at University College London, and since March 2020, we have continued to come together online. Each month, we select a short SF story to read, which is offered online in Chinese and its English translation. During our meetings, we explore the story’s SF themes, literary styles and even translation techniques and choices, as a way to better understand the piece, as well as the evolving field of contemporary Chinese SF. Our sessions are chatty and informal, because we are a mixed group of SF fans, newcomers to SF, native and non-Chinese speakers, researchers, but it seems we are all bookworms! 
            <br><br>We work directly with SF authors and translators across the world, and for our online monthly meetings, we have been inviting them to discuss their own stories with our LCSFG reading community. We also share upcoming events and research conferences from the wider field of sinophone SF through our social media channels and WeChat group.

As a ‘creative climate change communicator’, she collaborates widely with visual artists, activists, speculative fiction authors and youth groups. She has a background in History of Art (UCL) and holds an MA in Climate Change (KCL). She researches across decolonial climate justice, geography, feminist sciences and contemporary speculative fiction. 
                <br> <br>Angela independently curates as <a href="http://wormworm.org/">Worm: art + ecology</a>, and recent projects include an Arts Council England DYCP research project on climate visual cultures in East Asia (2019), and an extensive exhibition project Climate Knowledges at MAMA in Rotterdam (2020).
                <br><br>She co-founded the London Chinese Science Fiction Group hosted at UCL, and her writing is published in Science Fiction (2020, MIT Press). 
                <br><br>Her artistic practice explores decolonial climate storytelling through video recordings, remote sensing and speculative fiction writing.  <a href="https://twitter.com/angelaytchan"> @angelaytchan</a>
